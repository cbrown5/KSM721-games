## Probability games

Silly probability games made for my stats class (KSM721). Fully vibe coded html and JS with some checking of equations for scientific accuracy. Use with caution!

## likelihood-distribution-game/

Looks at how changing a mean affects the model's likelihood, in this case the model is just a normal density. 

## regression-likelihood-game/

Looks at how changing a slope and intercept affect the likelihood of a regression given a sample.
